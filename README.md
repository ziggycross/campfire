# Campfire: Cozy environment renderer

Campfire is a project for me to learn OpenGL and foundational computer graphics concepts.  
I was inspired by "3D pixel art" renderers online and am aiming to make something similar.  

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic rendering
- [x] Model loading
- [x] Model texturing
- [x] Render still frame
- [x] Render animation
- [ ] Settings toolbar
- [ ] Headless mode
- [ ] Grass rendering
- [ ] Water rendering
- [ ] Fire rendering
- [ ] Foliage rendering

## User guide

Supports: *Windows/Mac/Linux*

The project can be compiled from `app.cpp`, you will need to include GLFW and Assimp.

- WASDEQ to move the camera.
- Mouse to rotate the camera.
- Space to toggle mouse lock.  

I recommend using [rgba-to-gif](https://github.com/ziggycross/rgba-to-gif) to convert your outputted frames to a nice animated GIF.

## Resources

My self-learning has significantly relied on:

- Tutorials from [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com).
- Tutorials from [Acerola](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t).
